# Audio Transcription Notes

## Description
This project was developed as part of the mentorship conducted by Professor Diego Fernandes on the RocketSeat platform during the Next Level Week (NLW) Expert event. The main objective of this project is to create a versatile application capable of automatically transcribing audio notes into text using a custom web API, or allowing the user to manually input text. Additionally, the application offers the functionality to save notes in browser storage, enabling later access. It also includes features for searching and deleting notes, providing a comprehensive note management experience for the user.
